# Classification of Medial Entorhinal Units

[Grid cells](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Grid_cells) are neurons in the [medial entorhinal cortex](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Entorhinal_cortex) (MEC) that are activated when the subject passes through multiple locations arranged in a hexagonal grid. Grid cells, along with other cells in the MEC such as head direction and speed cells, form circuits with place cells to create a comprehensive positioning system in the brain.

This project therefore attempts to provide a classification system to identify grid cells located in the medial entorhinal cortex in order to better understand the navigational building blocks necessary for important memory processes.
