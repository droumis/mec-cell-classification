# Classification of Medial Entorhinal Units

## The Medial Entorhinal Cortex

The [medial entorhinal cortex](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Entorhinal_cortex) (MEC) is an important structure for hippocampal – neocortical interactions and is thought to mediate the majority of bidirectional projections between the neocortex and the rest of the hippocampus. Anatomically, most of the neocortical projections to the hippocampus are relayed through the MEC superficial layers, whereas hippocampal output projections to the neocortex transit mostly in entorhinal cortex deep layers. Therefore, the superficial and deep layers of the MEC have been regarded as the input and output structures of the hippocampus, respectively. However, despite its important role in declarative memories, little is known about the memory processes that take place in the MEC. 

## Grid Cells

[Grid cells](http://www.scholarpedia.org/article/Grid_cells) are neurons in the MEC that are activated when the subject passes through multiple locations arranged in a hexagonal grid. Grid cells, along with other cells in the MEC such as head direction and speed cells, form circuits with place cells to create a comprehensive positioning system in the brain. 

Because the MEC accounts for initial position, head direction, and speed, it contains all the components necessary for path integration. The ability to classify cells in the MEC will then result in a better understanding of what navigational building blocks are important for memory processes.
